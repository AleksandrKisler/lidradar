# Backend specification

## Purpose

The LidRadar backend is implemented in Go as a modular monolith. This document
is the starting point for backend requirements and contracts. Feature-specific
behavior should be added here, or linked from here, before it is implemented.

## Baseline contract

- PostgreSQL is the source of truth for persistent application state.
- Business capabilities must respect the module and dependency rules in
  [`../architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md).
- Inputs are validated at the system boundary; domain invariants are enforced
  inside the owning module.
- Failures must be represented deliberately and must not expose credentials,
  internal implementation details, or sensitive data.
- State changes that must succeed or fail together use an explicit PostgreSQL
  transaction with a clearly identified owner.
- External or asynchronous side effects must account for retries and
  idempotency; they must not override PostgreSQL as the authoritative state.

## Feature specifications

No feature-level backend contract has been approved yet. A backend change must
define its observable behavior, data ownership, error behavior, and operational
requirements before production code is added.

Architecture changes require an ADR; see [`../adr/README.md`](../adr/README.md).
